Tower_Defense
=============
This is going to be an open-source **Linux** game! Hooray! I will be using **SDL** as my wonderful gaming library. SDL is fun just like sleeping.

Currently, the goal is to (eventually) have a TD game that has multiple maps going at once. You would have to manage all of them as waves come simoultaneously. You could send resources between the maps (each map would be its own city/planet/area) but there would be a time delay and possibly a shipping cost. On each map the waves would fluctuate differently and towers costs would be different. Resources in this game will be colors (i.e. RGB). By buying your towers with different ratios of colors, you will get towers with slightly different stats (and of different colors). Hopefully this will be fun and all. Just like sleep.

Install
=======
1.  To install, you will need to have installed the following: gcc, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf
2.  Then, just make and run
3.  Now you're ready to have fun!
