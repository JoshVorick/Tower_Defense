Tower_Defense
=============
This is going to be an open-source Linux game! Hooray! I will be using SDL as my wonderful gaming library. SDL is fun just like sleeping.
Currently, the goal is to (eventually) have a TD game that has multiple maps going at once. You would have to manage all of them as waves come simoultaneously. You could send resources between the maps (each map would be its own city/planet/area) but there would be a time delay and possibly a cost. On each map the waves would fluctuate differently and towers costs would be different. Hopefully this will be fun and all. Just like sleep.
